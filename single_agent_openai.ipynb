      "The ongoing conflict between Pakistan and India continues to escalate, with tensions running high across the Kashmir border. India has accused Pakistan of funding and encouraging \"cross-border terrorism\" in Muslim-majority Kashmir.

Both countries have taken measures such as suspending the Indus Waters Treaty, closing airspace to each other's airlines, and expelling diplomats.\n",
